## Session 1: Trellis bootstrap: PRD review + source-backed backend spec

**Date**: 2026-06-14
**Task**: Trellis bootstrap: PRD review + source-backed backend spec
**Branch**: `main`

### Summary

Reviewed all 11 Trellis PRDs against source; fixed parent roadmap (4->9 child tasks listed, spec-bootstrap sequenced first as hard prerequisite) and corrected decoder PRD's NoAudioTrack wording. Added P1/P2/backlog/release-gate priority tiers, bumping the decoder seek double-trim bug fix ahead of DSP enhancements. Implemented the spec-bootstrap task: rewrote 6 placeholder backend spec files with source-backed content and added realtime-safety.md (hot-path invariant), all verified by trellis-check against live source (1 fix: missing loudness.rs in tree). Committed whole .trellis/ system; gitignored per-developer agent tooling dirs.
